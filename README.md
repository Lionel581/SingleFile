# SingleFile

## Introduction
SingleFile is a browser extension that saves an entire web page — including images, stylesheets, fonts, frames, and other resources — as a single self-contained HTML file. Saved pages can be viewed offline in any browser without installing an extension.

Ideal for researchers, students, and professionals who need reliable offline copies or archival records of web content.

Supported browsers: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari. SingleFile is free and open source (AGPL).
